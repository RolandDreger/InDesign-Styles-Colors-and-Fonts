# InDesign ‚Äì Styles, Colors and Fonts

Where the heck are all the styles, colors, and fonts in the document? How do they get into? And under what circumstances can they be removed without side effects or not?

Sometimes searching for it fails, sometimes you can delete it, but the settings will be lost. Here is an attempt to make a (complete ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) checklist.

## General Notes

### Book Synchronization
Styles and colors can get into the document via the book synchronization. These can be deleted without warning message if they are not applied in the current document.

### Search in IDML
Sometimes you can reach your goal faster if you search for "orphaned" formats in the IDML file.

1. Export InDesign document as IDML
2. Change the file extension to .zip
3. Unpack the ZIP folder
4. Search in the unpacked files e.g. for the name of the style
